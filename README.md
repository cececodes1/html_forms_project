## Overview
This project is part of **Module 7, Lesson 3: HTML Forms** and aims to demonstrate proficiency in creating HTML5 forms using various input types. The form enhances user experience and accessibility by implementing HTML5 features, input validation, and accessibility best practices.

### 1. Exploring New HTML5 Input Types
- **Email Input**: Collects an email address with HTML5 validation to ensure only valid emails are accepted.
- **Number Input**: Gathers a quantity with minimum, maximum, and step attributes for user guidance.
- **Date Input**: Allows users to select a date within a specified range.
- **Range Input**: Provides a slider to collect a rating, with the current value displayed.
- **Color Input** (Bonus): Allows users to select a color, with a value pre-selected.

### 2. Building a Comprehensive Web Form
- **Select Menu**: Allows users to choose their favorite programming language from a list.
- **Radio Buttons**: Allows users to indicate their level of expertise.
- **Checkboxes**: Allows users to pick their preferred development platforms.

## Key Features
- **Form Validation**: HTML5 form validation is implemented for fields like email and number inputs to ensure proper user input.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and `for` labels are used to enhance the form's accessibility for users with disabilities.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The range input displays the selected value as the user slides it.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure and form elements.
- **CSS**: For basic styling to improve the form's appearance.
